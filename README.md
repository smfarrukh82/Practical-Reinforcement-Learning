# Practicle-Reinforcement-Learning
This book is divided into three parts. The first part starts with defining reinforcement
learning. It describes the basics and the Python and Java frameworks we are going to use it
in this book. The second part discusses learning techniques with basic algorithms such as
temporal difference, Monte Carlo and policy gradient with practical examples. The third
part applies reinforcement learning with the most recent and widely used algorithms with
practical applications. We end with practical implementations of case studies and current
research activities.
